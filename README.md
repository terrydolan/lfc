This [lfc notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/terrydolan/prem/blob/master/lfc.ipynb) analyses Liverpool Football Club's premier league performance in seasons 2004-05 to 2014-15 using IPython Notebook, python, pandas and matplotlib to investigate the data publicly available sources. The data csv files are in the data sub-directory and descibed in the notebook. 

The seasons cover 11 years, from Rafael Benitez' first match in August 2004 to Brendan Rogers' most recent match in May 2015. Several graphs are generated automatically from the munged data to help describe LFC's performance.

See [Terry's blog about lfc](http://terrydolan.blogspot.com/2015/05/lfc-from-rafa-to-rogers-there-are-three.html) for more information.

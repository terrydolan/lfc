This [lfc notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/terrydolan/lfc/blob/master/lfc.ipynb) analyses Liverpool Football Club's premier league performance in seasons 2004-05 to 2014-15 using IPython Notebook, python, pandas and matplotlib to investigate publicly available data sources. The data files are in the *data* sub-directory and descibed in the notebook. 

The seasons cover 11 years, from Rafael Benitez' first match of season 2004-05 in August 2004 to Brendan Rogers' final match of season 2014-15 in May 2015. 

Many graphs are generated automatically from the munged data to help describe LFC's performance.
